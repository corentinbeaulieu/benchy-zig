# Benchy

Automated benching tool written in zig. The first goal of this project is to learn a bit more about zig.
The application runs commands given in a configuration file multiple times and gives metrics on the execution time.

It is thought to compare different version of a given program.

## TO DO

### Features

- [ ] Take a proper configuration file as input (yaml, JSON, zon ?)
- [X] Take the number of time the programs will be launch
- [X] Return the data (csv)
- [ ] Possibility to give a path to the config file we want
- [ ] Possibility to do warm-up runs
- [X] Generate a script to plot the results
- [ ] Make the timestamp human-readable (`DD-MM-YYYY-hh-mm-ss`)
- Options
    - [X] Change the csv name
    - [X] Don't generate csv or stdout
    - [X] Don't generate script
    - [ ] Choose script format ? (gnuplot? python? ...?)
    - [ ] Change script, plot name
    - [X] Display help
    - [ ] Throw the stdout of the measured programs
- Add other metrics
    - [ ] memory usage
    - [X] binary size

### Debug

- [ ] Enhance (memory management, idiomatic zig, builtins... )
- [ ] Get the `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` clock for measure
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Fix the gnuplot script (placement issue)
- [ ] Fix size retrievement on non-local file (`which` and absolute path ?)

## Installation

```bash
$ zig build
```
The executable is located in `zig-out/bin/`

## Usage

The available options :
```
benchy --help
    -h, --help
            Display this help and exit

        --no_csv
            Don't write a csv file of the results

 
        --no_script
            Don't write a gnuplot script template (automatically selected if no csv is requested)       
        
        --no_stdout
            Don't print the results on the standard output

    -o, --csv_filename <str>
            Name to give to the output csv
```

The program reads a `benchy.yml` (it is not a yaml file yet) file describing the bench to run.
This file must be located in the current working directory when invoking the program.

<details>
<summary> Here is an example: </summary>

```
10         <---- number of run for each program
2          <---- number of prorams to run
./my_prog  <---- commands to run
./my_prog2 
```

</details>

It outputs the results to the standard output for the moment.
It also generates a csv file in `./benchy-output/`. The file is timestamped by default.
By default, a simple gnuplot script is generated to plot the csv.

## Ideas

### Yaml configuration file

The yaml may look like this :

```yaml
bench1:
  number_of_programs: 2
  number_of_runs: 32
  programs: [ {name: 'my_prog', argv: "./my_prog"}, {name: 'my_prog2', argv: "./my_prog2"}]
  output: "path/to/output.csv"
bench2: ...
```

The idea is to have multiple bench suites and the difference computation will be made only within those.
We will use [zig-yaml](https://github.com/kubkon/zig-yaml).

### Zon configuration file

The zon will look like the input structure:

<details>
<summary> Option 1 </summary>

```zig
.{
    .name = "name of the bench",
    .nb_run = nombre de runs,
    .names = .{ "name of", "the programs" },
    .argvs = .{ 
        .{"./prog1"}, 
        .{"./prog2", "arg1", "arg2"}
    },
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary> Option 2 </summary>

```zig
.{
    .name = "name of the bench",
    .nb_run = nombre de runs,
    .tests = .{
        .{
            .name = "name of",
            .argv = .{"./prog1"},
        },
        .{
            .name = "the program",
            .argv = .{ "./prog1", "arg1", "arg2" },
        },
    },
}
```

</details>

We may use [eggzon](https://github.com/ziglibs/eggzon) or find the standard one or write our own.

### Change the clock

The standard library has a timer meant to measure this kind of events.
It can be a good idea to use it instead of the `clock_gettime`.
